# Week 1 Ship: Mar 22, 2019

Hi Everyone,

We’re excited to begin work on the Army ARL Path Analysis (PA). To share with y'all our evolving learning and progress, we at 18F like to send what we call a Weekly Ship. This is our Week 1 ship.

**Our asks of you:**

- We’ll revisit our problem statement (see What we’re thinking about section below) as we learn more to make sure we’re solving the right problem. Does this seem like a good place to start to you?
- We’ve assembled a project team (see What we’re thinking about section below). Who additionally should be on the team for us to be successful?

**This week we:**

- Conducted desk research on OSS Policy, Army, AFC, and ARL organizational structures and missions
- Conducted intro call with Jin Kwon
- Met with Jin to align on team collaboration and communication practices
- Scheduled weekly sprint meetings to structure project work
- Set up Slack, [GitHub repository](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process), [Trello](https://trello.com/b/MU2Dlyz6/us-army-arl-path-analysis) (invite sent to you) tools to support project work. Invites to these tools forthcoming, feel free to join in as we begin to use these tools!
- Created a database to track project contacts
- Booked travel and completed visitor paperwork for next week’s onsite visit
- Introduced ourselves to the Open Source Software Task Force, including sharing the 18F Outcomes & Process deck (see attached)
- Conducted 2 virtual team work sessions with Jin to learn about OSS Policy
- Contacted folks at the Defense Digital Service (DDS), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Department of the Interior (DOI), and Census Bureau through the Code.gov listserv to discuss navigating Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)
- Toured the Army Applications Lab in Austin, TX
- Crafted an initial problem statement
- Tentatively scheduled mid-project check in (April 10) and final presentation (May 8) onsite visits

**Next week we will:**

- Host Jin Kwon at 1800F for initial onsite preparation meeting on Tuesday
- Meet Jin and various OSS Task Force members in person at ARL during kickoff and initial research meetings Wednesday and Thursday
- Seek introductions to relevant AFC contacts in Austin, TX
- Develop relationship with Code.mil team
- Begin drafting a research plan to guide our Week 3 and Week 4 research

**Blockers:**

- None at this time

**What we’re thinking about:**

- Stating one problem at the beginning of a project helps us focus our efforts on one starting point into understanding a more complex, ambiguous issue. We’ve selected one actor in the process, the researcher, and focused on one obstacle we’ve learned they face.
  - **Problem Statement:** A researcher who feels frustrated about sharing knowledge with non-DoD groups needs to share research with collaborators, but faces a lot of effort and time to follow DoD guidance and instructions.
- Here’s the project team so far
  - Jin Kwon (ARL-CISD, MD): **Focus:** Technical assistant to the Director. Senior Operations Research Analyst (ORA), DB-1515-04, Technical Assistant to the Director (TAD), Computational and Information Sciences Directorate (CISD) and Senior Researcher, Weapons and Materials Research Directorate (WMRD), Army Research Laboratory (ARL). **Education:** Master of Science (MS), 2014, National Resource Strategy with Senior Acquisition Course diploma
  - Kathryn (account manager, NYC): **Focus:** building long-term relationships with partners, ensuring 18F delivers value. **Other projects:** building relationships and setting up work with the Air Force’s [Kessel Run team](https://kesselrun.af.mil/), working alongside the White House and HHS to research and build on SAMHSA’s [Treatment Locator](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-treatment).  Experience: 18F for over four years, previously Peace Corps volunteer based in China. **Education:** BA in International Studies.
  - Andrew (engineer, DC): **Focus:** human-centered design, software development. Experience: Process and task research with University of Tennessee (research-focused radiology software, NLP). Maintainer of two large (50+ contributor) open source projects on GitHub. **Education:** B.S. in Computer Science, focus in Human-Computer Interactions (HCI).
  - Eleni (strategist & project lead, Austin): **Focus:**  Problem definition, design research, delivering actionable, realistic strategies.

**The numbers:**

Last week we billed $3,550 on this engagement which leaves $191,450 remaining. This puts us on track for a 5/10 end date.

Thanks,
