# Week 2 Ship: March 29, 2019

Hello everyone!

This week we came together as a team at GSA and ARL to work in-person, refined our problem focus, and conducted initial meetings (thank you for your time!). 

Our problem statement has narrowed a bit to focus specifically on ARL: ARL needs to be able to efficiently and transparently share open source software within legal requirements, but the current approach feels imbalanced. 

Based on our initial meetings, we feel that by narrowing the focus of the project to ARL, we can have a bigger impact more broadly — if we can demonstrate handling ARL’s open source software needs excellently, the impacts beyond ARL can be made more powerful. All that to say — we’re narrowing our focus, but not being myopic!

**Our asks of you:**

- We’ve identified key groups to represent in our research (see *What We’re Thinking About* section below). Can you review and tell us who we’ve missed?
- We’ve decided on project outcomes and measures of success (see below). How do these align with what’s most important in your view?

**This week we:**

- Met with Code.mil to discuss ARL’s OSS policy and how it relates to ongoing work elsewhere in the DoD
- Hosted Jin Kwon at 1800F for initial onsite meeting
- Aligned the team around 3 project outcomes and 3 measures of excellence (see in What We’re Thinking About section below)
- Socialized as a team in person to get to know each other better
- Conducted introductory meetings with Task Force members and researchers to (1) get feedback on project scope, goals, and success measures, (2) validate our understandings so far, and (3) to identify potential participants 
- Debriefed after onsite meetings and incorporated learnings into research plan, stakeholder diagram, and problem statement
- Created a diagram of identified stakeholders [(see attached)](/Deliverables/ARL%20Stakeholder%20Map%20March%2029.pdf)
- Created a research plan to guide our Week 3 and Week 4 research
- Began identifying Task Force members who cannot access project Slack, [GitHub repository](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process), [Trello](https://trello.com/b/MU2Dlyz6/us-army-arl-path-analysis) tools
- Refined initial problem statement
- Began reaching out to schedule initial interviews for next week

**Next week we will:**

- Finalize our interview questions as a part of our research plan
- Schedule and begin performing round one interviews
- Meet with AFC contacts in Austin, TX

**Risks:**

- [Low] One assumption we’ve learned so far regarding open source software (OSS) sharing at ARL, is that if open source sharing was more transparent and efficient, it would increase code sharing at ARL. We see a risk in relying on this assumption so we’ll be trying to test this in our first round of interviews.

**What we’re thinking about:**

- **Project timeline:** 18F partners with agency partners on 8 week projects called Path Analyses, to define a strategic problem to tackle, identify potential solutions, and demonstrate what they might look/feel like.

  | Weeks 1–2 | Weeks 3–4 | Weeks 5–6 | Weeks 7–8 |
  |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | Kickoff<br>Plan research<br>Conduct initial research<br><br><strong>WE ARE HERE</strong> | Conduct more research<br>Discuss initial findings<br>Revise problem focus if needed<br>Mid-project check-in | Finish research<br>Analyze and discuss findings<br>Incorporate team feedback<br>Develop, discuss, prioritize recommendations | Incorporate team feedback<br>Final presentation |

- **Research plan:** Here’s our plan for who we’ll learn from.

  | Week | Round | Focus | 
  |------|-------|-------|
  | 3/27 - 4/5 | Round 1 | ARL Developer<br>ARL Supervisor<br>ARL Security<br>ARL Invention Evaluation Committee<br>ARL IP/Legal |
  | 4/8 - 4/12 | Round 2 | ARL Business Acumen<br>ARL OSS Policy Administrator<br>ARL Public Affairs<br>DoD CIO

- **Project outcomes:** At the end of this project, we will 
  - Deliver independent evaluation of ARL’s current open source policies and practices
  - Generate a set of open source software standards and recommendations
  - Create a roadmap of opportunities and recommendations on how to take action
- **Success measures:** We’ll know we’re successful if these outcomes
  - Are implementable at ARL
  - Reflect a diverse set of viewpoints
  - Resonate as useful to others in the federal government that want to open source software   

**What we’re reading:**
- [Introduction to remote moderated usability testing](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/11/14/introduction-to-remote-moderated-usability-testing-part-1/)

**The numbers:**
- Last week we billed $23,392 on this engagement which leaves $168,058 remaining. This puts us on track for a 5/10 end date. 

Thanks,
- Andrew, Kathryn, Eleni
