# Week 7 Ship: May 3, 2019

Good Afternoon,

We are nearing the end of this engagement. Our recommendations demonstrate everything we have learned during our time partnering with ARL, as well as what we believe will best help ARL move forward in its OSS endeavors. We’re delivering our recommendations to you today to give you time to review and generate any questions or comments before our Final Presentation next week. We’ll incorporate the fruits of that discussion into our report before closing out the engagement on May 10, 2019. Read on for more details…

**Our asks of you:**

- Please let us know if you have not received an invite to the Final Presentation next week at ARL.

**This week we:**

- Reconnected with Jin Kwon and discussed findings and recommendations
- Incorporated feedback received into our recommendations
- Finalized our recommendations (see attached)
- Finalized stakeholder map, process maps into MS-suite editable artifacts (see attached)
- Worked with 18F designer Julia Lindpainter to polish all existing project deliverables
- Worked with 18F’s Product Management team to refine recommendations and brainstorm potential product manager training opportunities
- Worked with Jin to develop a project brief for various leadership audiences
- Scheduled meeting with AFC stakeholder for next week, to share findings and recommendations

**Next week we will:**

- Prepare agenda and presentation for Week 8 Review/Final Presentation on May 8, 2019, 9-12pm ET
- Finalize project report
- Finalize project visuals
- Post and organize all project artifacts on GitHub
- Deliver all project artifacts to Jin
- Meet with AFC to share project findings and recommendations 

**What we’re thinking about:**

- What we can do to help ARL decide how to take immediate and aligned action on our recommendations.
  - What seems on or off the table at this time, given ARL’s current reality and priorities?
  - Should the ARL OSS Process Map (Intended) and ARL OSS Process Map (Perceived) be displayed, and if so where?
  - What are actionable next steps, and for whom, to kickstart internal conversations on OSS goals, priorities, and needs?
- Where we’re at in our project timeline: 

  | Weeks 1–2 | Weeks 3–4 | Weeks 5–6 | Weeks 7–8 |
  |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | Kickoff<br>Planning<br>Research<br> | Research<br>Initial findings<br>Mid-project check-in | Research<br>Finalize findings<br>Feedback<br>Recommendations | Feedback<br>Final presentation<br><strong>WE ARE HERE</strong> |

**The numbers:**

- Last week we billed $22,443 on this engagement. We have billed $137,644 total which leaves $57,356 remaining. This puts us on track for a 5/10 end date. 

Thanks!

Andrew, Kathryn, and Eleni
