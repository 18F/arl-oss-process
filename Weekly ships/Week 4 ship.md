# Week 4 Ship: April 12, 2019

Good afternoon team! 

This week is the midpoint of 8-weeks at ARL, marked by our mid-project check-in held on Thursday morning onsite. We’re continuing with our second round of interviews this week and next, and are reviewing research materials that you’ve provided to us over the last four weeks. Thank you! 

**Our asks of you:**

- We’ve learned that meeting change notifications don’t work between gsa.gov and mail.mil calendar accounts. From this point forward, when a meeting needs to be rescheduled, we’ll cancel the invitation and re-send. We will send fresh invites for remaining Weekly Reviews and Final Presentation. **Can you please delete any existing invites on your calendar?**
- We’ve updated the [process map](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1554322454728/27f8a1bf135b313ff65fb2da72ef9d2d0797e099). Comments can be added to the map by (1) clicking the link above and right clicking anywhere on the map, or (2) reviewing the [attached pdf](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process/blob/47be79801ede860444ee42f218fe675989713abf/Deliverables/Process%20Map%20April%2012.pdf) and emailing us back. **What do you agree/disagree/have questions with?**

**This week we:**

- Developed initial findings from our desk and interview research so far
- Updated the [process map](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1554322454728/27f8a1bf135b313ff65fb2da72ef9d2d0797e099) based on our initial findings ([attached](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process/blob/47be79801ede860444ee42f218fe675989713abf/Deliverables/Process%20Map%20April%2012.pdf))
- Updated the [stakeholder map](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1553741709934/ee42f91e425204a70aca0917a27cd2fff5d7d67c) based on our initial findings ([attached](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process/blob/47be79801ede860444ee42f218fe675989713abf/Deliverables/ARL%20Stakeholder%20Map%20April%2012.pdf))
- Prepared Mid-project Check-in presentation ([attached](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process/blob/47be79801ede860444ee42f218fe675989713abf/Deliverables/Mid-project%20check-in%20presentation.pdf))
- Generated [Key Questions](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1553789837161/0b3cbe5300499ea4e461e7facb1081314274a366) based on our initial findings ([attached](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process/blob/47be79801ede860444ee42f218fe675989713abf/Deliverables/Key%20Questions%20April%2012.pdf))
- Traveled onsite to ARL in Adelphi, MD
- Learned about the capabilities of ServiceNow, an automation framework
- Scheduled additional round 2 interviews
- Conducted desk research on ARL policy documents
- Conducted Mid-project Check-in, including a group review of the process map
- Determined which, if any, can be scheduled into the remaining project timeline
- Prepared for research synthesis

**Next week we will:**

- Conduct more round 2 interviews
- Meet with Code.gov about successful OSS in government
- Determine what role ServiceNow has in ARL’s OSS process
- Conduct research synthesis
- Generate research findings and share with project stakeholders
- Begin developing initial recommendations
- Begin brainstorming appropriate deliverables to successfully achieve stated project outcomes
- Perform additional desk research on:
  - Policy documents influencing ARL’s OSS needs and current process
  - Process guidance material used by ARL users
  - Process guidance material used by OSS leads
  - Similar OSS policies in similar environments (government groups with mixed government/contractor employees)
  - Documents relating to ARL’s Form 1 process

**What we’re thinking about:**

- Mid-project Check-in discussion, which focused on:
  - Does “open source” mean code that is freely available for download, and use, and modification? Or code released under certain licenses which rely on copyright? Lack of clarity can have consequences on the OSS process downstream.
  - What formally defines “open source collaboration”?
  - There are two branches to ARL’s OSS needs, legacy software projects which have already been in the works and for which the software has already been written (and may be desired to open source later), and new software projects which are being planned today. 
  - Collaborators (someone who ARL has a joint work agreement with) and contributors (anyone who makes modifications to ARL’s open source projects) have different needs.
  - The use of email for records-keeping in the OSS process.
  - The manual labor on the part of the researcher to push a project through and how these efforts benefit their performance.
  - Security, Public Affairs, and Tech Transfer groups are involved the process more so than we previously thought.
  - It is unclear who/which group will own responsibility for ARL’s OSS process long-term.
  - There are additional important questions for ARL to answer that are upstream from asking how to design an easy-to-navigate legally-sound ARL OSS policy & process (see Key Questions attached)
- In our remaining time available for researcher we have:
  - Scheduled ARL CISD leadership, ARL researcher (contractor), and ARL business acumen groups.
  - Not reached ARL CIO, ARL CIO/OSS, or DoD CIO.
  - Identified three additional stakeholder groups as Tech Transfer, Security, and Public Affairs.
- Ideally, we’d interview more than one representative from each group — but given our limited timeline, we do not expect to be able to interview representatives from the remaining groups.
- Project timeline:


  | Weeks 1–2 | Weeks 3–4 | Weeks 5–6 | Weeks 7–8 |
  |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | Kickoff<br>Planning<br>Research<br> | Research<br>Initial findings<br>Mid-project check-in<br><strong>WE ARE HERE</strong> | Research<br>Finalize findings<br>Feedback<br>Recommendations | Feedback<br>Final presentation |

**The numbers:**

- Last week we billed $20,216 on this engagement which leaves $120,932 remaining. This puts us on track for a 5/10 end date. 

Thanks, 
Andrew, Kathryn, and Eleni
