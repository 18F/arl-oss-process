# Week 3 Ship: April 5, 2019

Good Morning ARL OSS Team & Stakeholders,

This week was all about research. Guided by the research plan we developed last week, we focused on interviewing folks representing various key groups involved in ARL’s OSS needs and current process. Next week, we’ll be continue research and travel onsite for an expanded Weekly Review doubling as our Mid-project Check-In.

**Our asks of you:**

- Each week we list our asks of you, but we have not gotten much feedback on these by email or Slack. Do you have thoughts on our previous weekly asks?
- We’ve shared our emerging ARL OSS process map. How does this resonate with your understanding of the current process?

**This week we:**

- Finalized our interview questions for researchers, OSS leads, and leadership participants
- Developed a checklist of procedures for each interview (see below for details)
- Scheduled and conducted round one interviews according to our checklist of procedures (see below for details)
- Scheduled round two interviews
- Created participant agreement for any non-government participants
- Conducted a team retro to identify what’s working well on the team, and where we can improve
- Aligned with Jin on team practices, documented in a project masterdoc
- Reviewed with Jin the data that we have collected & scrubbed so far
- Planned travel for onsite Week 4 Review/Mid-Project Check-in on April 11
- Created an initial ARL OSS process map based on data collected so far
- Requested tour of ARL including areas where key research groups work on a daily basis
- Shared problem statement and project outcomes with Nate Parker at AFC HQ in Austin, TX
- Collected additional DoD, Army, and ARL policy documents for review
- Met with NASA and code.gov to learn their successes/lessons learned on OSS policies and procedures
- Updated the project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/18F/arl-oss-process) and [Trello](https://trello.com/b/MU2Dlyz6/us-army-arl-path-analysis)

**Next week we will:**

- Conduct round two interviews according to our checklist of procedures (see below for details)
- Prepare a Week 4 Review/Mid-Project Check-in presentation
- Review with Jin the data that we have collected & scrubbed so far
- Conduct ARL Tour (April 10) & onsite Week 4 Review/Mid-Project Check-in (April 11)
- Identify additional key groups to interview, if needed
- Request relevant AFC leadership presentations from AUSA Global Symposium to ensure project outcomes align with leadership visions 
- Conduct desk research on relevant DoD, Army, and ARL policy documents
- Consider whether an overview of ServiceNow functionality is needed
- Begin synthesizing interview and desk research

**What we’re thinking about:**

- **Data:** We’ve pulled out data points from 2 interviews collected so far, and will have data from 5 interviews to share in next week’s onsite visit. We’re pulling data into two directions: (1) general data points on ARL OSS needs & the current process, and (2) to create process map based on individuals’ perceptions ([see attached](/Deliverables/Process%20Map%20Apr%205.pdf)). 
- **Interview Procedures:** To ensure we are capturing participant ideas accurately and preserving participant confidentiality
  - Designate interview lead and note-taker
  - Note-taker corrects typos/cleans up notes
  - Lead adds any additional notes
  - Lead sends follow up email to participant
  - Lead pulls ideas/quotes into private Mural (virtual whiteboard workspace) viewable only by 18F team
  - Note-taker reviews ideas/quotes to ensure no personally-identifying information is included
  - Note-taker copies ideas/quotes into team Mural viewable by 18F + Jin for upcoming data synthesis
