# Week 5 Ship: April 19, 2019

Hi everyone,

This is the end of week 5 on the Army ARL PA. We've wrapped up our interview and desk research. We’ve generated our findings from the interview data that we shared in today’s review. Next week we’ll be synthesizing the desk research into findings and drafting our recommendations for your feedback. Read on for more details…

**Our asks of you:**

- Envision that it’s after May 10, 2019 and this Army ARL Path Analysis has wrapped. **What project artifact would best help you** communicate about this project to someone else at ARL? Someone outside of ARL? Why?
- We’re unsure on a few steps in the [process map](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1554322454728/27f8a1bf135b313ff65fb2da72ef9d2d0797e099). **Can you help us?**
- **What is the IP panel;** is it distinct from IEC?
