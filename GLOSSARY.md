| TRL | Technology Readiness Level | A method of estimating technology maturity of Critical Technology Elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. They are determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities. TRL are based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)
| CTE | Critical Technology Elements | A new or novel technology that a platform or system depends on to achieve successful development or production or to successfully meet a system operational threshold requirement. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a method of estimating technology maturity of CTE of a program during the Acquisition Process. They are determine during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities.
