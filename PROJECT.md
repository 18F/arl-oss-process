### Team practices

#### Project Management
- As we think of new tasks, we add them to the backlog.
- If any of the new tasks we added need to happen before the next sprint, discuss in next standup.
- During sprint planning, we set an overarching "sprint goal" and move the tasks that we want to accomplish that week from the backlog to "To Do".
- Self-assign tasks once we move them to Doing.
- If we want someone to look something over that we did, we move the card to “ Review,” and assign them to the card and @mention them on Slack. Once reviewed, card can be moved as appropriate. If f/u action is needed by someone, @mention them on Slack.

#### Note-taking
- Before each meeting, designate a note-taker.
- Notify the participant that the note-taker will be taking notes.
- Right after meeting, the person who didn’t take notes should go in and add any notes and pull out takeaways.
- Notetaker pulls out takeaways too.
- Meeting notetakers toss any actionable tasks from the meeting discussion into Trello.

#### Research
- See the [research plan](research/plan.md).
- Research work is broken up into defined "sprints." Before we start a sprint, we set a research goal for that sprint and decide on the methods we will use (eg, if interviews, we decide how many subjects we need to talk to, with what characteristics, and adjust our discussion guide according to the research goal). 
- At the end of a research sprint, we come together to analyze what we found more thoroughly than we do in our daily debriefs, to analyze what we heard, make deeper connections, check in on whether our hypotheses were confirmed or disproved, and capture any decisions we make about how our findings shape the outputs we are working towards, and how we structure our next sprint to help drive us towards those outputs.

##### Interviews
- One person interviews, one person takes notes.
- Notify the participant that the note-taker will be taking notes.
- Interview starts with introduction. Notes should be as verbatim as possible.
- Folks should not lead interviews with participants that they have a close relationship with. 
- Drop signed consent form in XXX
- Within 24 hours of interview:
  - Lead interviewer should go through notes and make sure any extra thoughts they jotted down get captured in there as well
  - lead interviewer follow ups with applicant (thank them for their time; capture any follow-up actions/questions; re-ping them for signed consent form if not yet received)
  - Lead interviewer pulls out interviewee’s ideas and quotes into Mural per participant number
  - Note taker scrubs data and copies into partner’s board.
- We extend our morning meetings to 45 minutes instead of 15, and use the first 30 mins to debrief the previous day's key observations (without partner), anything that was surprising, and capture any adjustments we want to make to our questions or practices based on what we're hearing, etc. before moving on to our regular 15-minute standup.
