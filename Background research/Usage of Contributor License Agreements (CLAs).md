# Usage of Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

From the [ARL Open Source Guidance and Instructions](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-Open-Source-Guidance-and-Instructions/tree/7639a0a607768646201c6c1d11ac972effec83fc#2DF49A4AC17C11E69E3A003EE1B763F8): 

> ARL relies on a combination of the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) and the contributor license agreement (ARL Form 266). All external contributors MUST execute and return a CLA to the project owners before their contributions can be accepted to ensure that all IP issues are settled.

This is unusual in the open source world — typically, there’s an implicit agreement that contributing code upstream is an adoption of that project’s license. How do other parts of the government deal with this? This research attempts to find out.

## Department of Defense

As per Jordan at the [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil/), “our [guidance on Code.mil](https://code.mil/how-to-open-source.html#step-4-contributions) is to use a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process.”

## Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Department of Energy)

As per Ian, “We were able to dodge that requirement.” From [their license guidelines](https://software.llnl.gov/about/licenses/): 

> … the default assumption for open source projects is “inbound license = outbound license”, i.e., contributors provide their code under the same license under which the code is distributed. If this is not enough assurance for your project, you may elect to use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) with your project.
>
> You are not required to use the DCO, and it may add overhead to your process that deters potential contributors. Unless you feel that you need this level of assurance for your project, we recommend that you simply rely on the default inbound = outbound assumption.
