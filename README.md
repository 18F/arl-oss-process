## U.S. Army Research Lab - 18F Path Analysis

18F is partnered with the Army Research Lab (ARL) in an 8 week path analysis (PA) focused on understanding ARL's Open Source Software needs and current process. Initially, the problem we focused on was that ARL needs to be able to efficiently and transparently share open source software within legal requirements, but the current OSS process feels top-heavy to researchers. This repo stores all project artifacts related to this PA. 

A cross-functional team from ARL and 18F set their vision on the following PA outcomes:

1. Generating an independent evaluation of ARL’s current open source policies and practices
2. Generating a set of open source software standards and recommendations
3. Creating a roadmap of opportunities and recommendations for ARL on how to take action

The team determined that in order for this PA to be successful, it would need to:

- Be implementable at ARL
- Reflect a diverse set of viewpoints
- Resonate as useful to others in the federal government that want to open source software
