Army Research Lab (ARL) needs to be able to efficiently and transparently share open source software within legal requirements, but the current approach feels imbalanced.

Outcomes of this project:

1. Independent evaluation of ARL’s current open source policies and practices
2. Generate a set of open source software standards and recommendations
3. Create a roadmap of opportunities and recommendations on how to take action

If this project is successful, it will:

- Be implementable at ARL
- Reflect a diverse set of viewpoints
- Resonate as useful to others in the federal government that want to open source software
