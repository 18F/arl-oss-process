# Army ARL PA Research Plan

## Objectives

Learn about OSS at ARL: goals, values, motivations, key players, constraints, training/support resources. Also, learn about current policy, practice, roles, opportunities and challenges.

## Method(s)

1. Interviews
2. Secondary research

## Key assumptions to test

- If open source sharing was more transparent and efficient, will it increase level of sharing?

## Stakeholder map

#### Introduction

> Subject: Request for interview
>
> Hi there! My name's [x]. I'm a [x] at 18F/GSA working with ARL on the Open Source Software path analysis team to better understand how ARL can efficiently and transparently share open source software within legal requirements. This project is an 8 week engagement.
>
> We’re hoping to learn about ARL’s open source software needs from all the key players involved, and we’d like to learn your perspective. Given the fast pace of this project, we’ve got about 2 weeks to learn all we can. Right now we’re scheduling [in person, on a call, video] [interview, demo, shadow] for next week at these times:

## Expected outcome(s)

We’ll collect on-the-record feedback (shared on a need-to-know basis) from Open Source Software leads and users and conduct collaborative synthesis, increasing our team’s shared understanding. 

## Desk research

We will review a variety of secondary research, which may include:

- Policy documents influencing ARL’s OSS needs and current process
- Process guidance material used by ARL users
- Process guidance material used by OSS leads
- Similar OSS policies in similar environments (government groups with mixed government/contractor employees)
- Documents relating to ARL’s Form 1 process


## Interview guides

Approach that may make it easier for participants to focus on their perceptions of open source sharing needs independent of current solution: focus on needs & goals first, and then ask about current process.

- Researcher
- OSS Leads
- Leadership

## Participant agreement

See the [Participant agreement](/Research/Participant%20agreement.md). (This is not required for interviews we conduct with government employees.)

## Data disposal

All **study data** collected during this research will be discarded after our collaborative synthesis exercise and/or persona creation, whichever is latest.
